## 🚀 What I Do

I design and build **end-to-end AI systems**:

- **LLM & NLP Applications** – conversational assistants, RAG-based QA systems, AI tutors  
- **Agentic Workflows** – multi-agent systems for code review, automation, and routing  
- **Business Automation** – document intelligence, invoice extraction, product recognition  
- **AI for Education & Content** – data science and SQL tutors, marketing content agents  

I like working at the intersection of **LLMs, vector search, and practical business problems**, and I enjoy validating new AI concepts quickly with real prototypes.
